            Primary School ( Grades 1-5)
            <br>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <br>
        The primary school (Grades I to V) follows a customised syllabus based on American psychologist Howard Gardener’s theory of Multiple Intelligences. The interdisciplinary approach acknowledges the existence of multiple types of intelligences and its diverse expression in each student; and the curriculum is designed to address all the versatile forms intelligence takes. Spatial, linguistic, logical-mathematical, kinesthetic, musical, interpersonal, intrapersonal and naturalist elements are incorporated into a well-rounded curriculum, such that every student can excel at whatever he or she does best, while improving any under-developed areas.

        Academics
        The curriculum at Primary school is not just textbook and knowledge but is holistic learning which focuses on value systems to sensitise young minds to the environment around them. The key areas that the primary school curriculum addresses are
        <br>
        Honing of listening, speaking, reading and writing skills, ( English )
        Building a strong foundation in mathematics, ( Math, Mindspark, Mental Math)
        An introduction to the subjects of science and social studies, (EVS)
        A grasp over the second language, (Hindi, Kannada)
        Nurturing an interest in the arts, craft, music and dance.
        An emphasis on physical education and sport.
        Prescribed text books
        <br>
        Classroom
        A typical classroom at Primary section at Deens is a vibrant and enriched learning space. What strikes you at first glance is that our class sizes are intimate – restricted to a small group of 30 students and 5 sections.
        Every day begins with circle time: Here the teacher discusses with the children Life skills and values which need to be reinforced time and again to ensure good behaviour and attitude in children.
        <br>

        Assessment
        At The Deens Academy, we follow a system of continuous multi-disciplinary assessment, which could be formal or informal. We also follow a differentiated system of assessment to cater to the varied needs of children.
        <br>
        The child seeking entry into Deens is evaluated on his/her skills and abilities in order to determine the level in comparison to the expectation of the class into which admission is sought. This helps the teacher to modulate the classroom transaction in order to meet the child’s needs.
        <br>
        With the firm belief that education touches the mind as well as the being and each influences the other, information regarding each student is collected, taking into account their ability to apply knowledge, their learning process and how they conduct themselves in different situations. These findings form the basis of a continuous feedback process to the student and parents. A systematic follow up programme is built around these evaluations, be it on the academic, co-scholastic or value/attitudinal front.
        <br>
        We recognise that the larger objective of the academic programme is to open minds and steer a child towards critical thinking and application. To this end, we administer assessments that are generated by our staff, keeping in mind the acceptable academic levels globally. Children experiment through and find their feet, thus honing critical life skills and sharpening their academic prowess. The curriculum is therefore designed to ensure that children are in a state of perpetual academic readiness.
        <br>
        Tasks could be varied within a class, homework, class work, projects, presentations- each lends to assessment, projecting a different aspect of the child’s learning.
        <br>
        Much of the assessment conducted is diagnostic, but we also take recourse to summative assessments at the end of each learning period
        <br>
        The school year is divided into 2 terms for grade 1 – 5 follow a continuous assessment pattern using the above methods with a summative assessment ant the end of every term. The marks are published on the student ERP page. The students of grade 1-10 are evaluated by a 9 point grading system. Each grade, given on the basis of both formative and summative assessments will correspond to the range of marks indicated below:
        <br>
        grade A1 A2 B1 B2 C1 C2 D E1 E2
        marks 91-100 81-91 71-80 61-70 51-60 41-50 33-40 22-32 0-21

        The School offers opportunities, within the curriculum, for students to participate in a range of activities like music, dance, yoga, art, craft, pottery, skating, swimming, basketball and athletics.
        <br>
        Extra curricular activities such as karate, dance, music, athletics, swimming, chess and Abacus classes are held at the campus to promote and hone talent in students. Children are encouraged to participate in any of these activities.
        <br>
        On entry into grade 1, all students become members of a House to foster a spirit of leadership, cooperation, mutual understanding, tolerance and self-reliance.
        <br>
        Various inter-house activities are organised to build team spirit. The House system gives opportunities to students to participate in inter-house competitions. Each House is led by a House Mistress who oversees the well-being and social development of members of the House. The four Houses have Latin names, each indicating qualities to be valued:–
        <br>
        Flavus (yellow-truth)
        Rubrus (red-strength)
        Caeruleus (blue-integrity)
        Prasinus (green-valour)
        The Houses are graded in the areas of:
        <br>
        (a) Sports
        (b) The Arts
        (c) Discipline

        There is so much happening in the classrooms, even with the constraint of being online. Students have adapted entirely and so have we teachers. The question of resuming normal physical school, now looms large at the horizon. While this decision would embrace parental consent, the quandary is that of re-adjusting and re-aligning processes and lifestyles. Among other things, the Pandemic.
